# reactive-navigation_raspi-only
This is a machine exercise in my Autonomous Robots class.
The goal is for the robot to do reactive navigation using only a camera module.

This repository contains publisher/subscriber, and gradio app codes.
The final product is an app that lets you choose which object you want turtlebot to hunt.  Starting the hunt will display a live feed of the camera including the objects detected by [YOLOWorld](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo-world/).  On its right, a live feed of the depth maps generated by [Depth-Anything-V2-base](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2)
